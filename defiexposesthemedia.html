  <h2 class="p1">DEFI Exposes the media &amp; the FED.</h2>
  <h3 class="p1">Explaining how the US Economy works in DEFI terms &amp; why the media &amp; fed is wrong.</h3>
  <p class="p2">Staking = Buying bonds with $USD</p>
  <p class="p2">More people staking = lower yields (also called interest rates by some)</p>
  <p class="p2">People stake because they trust the project (government)</p>
  <p class="p2">When people do not trust the project (government) they unstable their $USD (leading to increased amount of circulating $USD, also called inflation)</p>
  <p class="p2">More people staking = less inflation because all the $USD is locked up</p>
  <p class="p2"><b>In simple terms:</b></p>

  <ul>
  <li class="p10">When people stake (buying bonds) they lock up their $USD which decreases money supply &amp; yield rates (APY).</li>
  <li class="p10">When people unstake (selling bonds) they unlock their $USD which increases money supply &amp; yield rates (APY).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="p2"><b>Dispelling myths spread by the Media &amp; the FED:</b></p>
  <p class="p2"><b>Media:</b></p>
  <p class="p2">Googling &ldquo;does higher interest rates cause inflation&rdquo; results in:</p>

  <ul class="ul1">
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span>&ldquo;In general, when interest rates are low, the economy grows, and inflation increases. Conversely,&nbsp;when interest rates are high, the economy slows and inflation decreases.&rdquo;</li>
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><b>&ldquo;</b>According to the quantity theory of money, a growing money supply increases inflation. Thus, low interest rates tend to result in more inflation. High interest rates tend to lower inflation.&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="p2"><b>Federal reserve:</b></p>

  <ul class="ul1">
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates this week to help tame inflation.</li>
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span>Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates in week ahead, as Ukraine crisis adds volatility</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="p2"><b>So according to the media &amp; the FED:</b></p>

  <ul class="ul1">
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span>Low interest rates = inflation</li>
  <li class="p10"><span class="s1"></span>High interest rates = deflation or slower inflation</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="p2">This does not match up with what I wrote above!</p>
  <p class="p2">When people stake (which lowers yield &amp; interest rates) they decrease the amount of circulating $USD in the system.</p>
  <p class="p2">This leads to deflation NOT inflation which the medias says above</p>
  <p class="p2">Don&rsquo;t believe me??</p>
  <p class="p2">Lets look at some real life examples</p>
  <p class="p2"><b>Countries with low interest rates: </b>Japan, Germany, Switzerland</p>
  <p class="p2">According to the media these countries should have HIGH inflation - which is not true.</p>
  <p class="p2"><b>Countries with high interest rates:</b> Brazil, Turkey, Venezuela</p>
  <p class="p2">According to the media these countries should have LOW inflation - which is not true.</p>
  <p class="p2">To wrap it up: The media &amp; the fed does not understand how the economy works, the defi/bond market proves them wrong time &amp; time again. Also the fed does NOT control interest rates the bond market does (but that&rsquo;s a whole another story which i will save for another day))</p>
  <p class="p2"><b>Addressing the Russia situation:</b> Russian bond yields just spiked which means people are unstaking.(just like APY goes up when people unstake) Expect to see huge inflation in Russia unless the Government can make drastic changes or trust is regained. And no, the inflation WONT be from the Russian Central Bank "printing" money (they cant do that, just like the FED cant print money either), it will be from people unstaking (increasing money supply).</p>
